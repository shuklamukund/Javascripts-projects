    <p id="para">Initially, the concentration of the dissolved gas in an eddy is uniform 
        at cAo and internally the eddy may be considered stagnant. 
        When the eddy is exposed to the gas at the interface, the concentration 
        in the liquid at the gas-liquid surface becomes cAi which may be taken 
        as the equilibrium solubility of the gas in the liquid.</p>
